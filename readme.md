Hello, this is Ahmed. This "social-media" site is developed in purpose of a full stack application. ExpressJS and Postgres is used in the server, and React in client.  
So basically we can create an account with some basic information, follow other accounts, create posts optionally with photo, and add like or comment to a post. Feed will serve the contents posted by the user's account and the accounts that are being 'followed' by the user. Profile will contain only the user's posts. You can delete a post if it's made by you, and delete a comment if it's made by you or it belongs to a post made by you.  
Also firebase storage is used to store profile pictures and post photos. It's not a huge thing, but probably I learned the MOST till now creating this project.
